This is a studdent project made during the year 2014-2015 at ESIEA (http://esiea.fr/).

This project use Annwvyn Engine (http://annwvyn.org or https://github.com/Ybalrid/LeapRift)

Before attempting to compile this demo, you need to install

- Oculus Runtime from OculusVR (http://oculus.com/ See the developer section) VERSION 0.5. **NOT 0.6.**
- LEAP Motion Runtime (http://leapmotion.com/ See the developer section. You'll need to create an account to be able to download the SDK
- Annwvyn SDK (See "Download" at http://annwvyn.org)
- Copy the LeapSDK folder inside your working directory (sdkcontent in the LeapSKD directory of this repo)

Open Game.sln, make sure you're un "release" mode, F7 to build.

Please connect an Oculus DK 1 or 2, a LeapMotion and fix the Leap at the center of the DK. We recomend using the official VR mont from the LEAP Motion store. 

Demos can be switched with 1, 2 and 3 from your number row. You can reload and unload the levels with return and backspace.

Mouse and keyboard (and Xbox 360) will move your avatar around but please note that the demos are intended to be used without any other interaction than the LEAP Motion controller.
